ALGORITHM TO FIND WHETHER A NUMBER IS PRIME OR COMPOSITE
1. START 
2. ACCEPT A POSITIVE INTEGER 'n'( NUMBER GREATER THAN 2)
3. INITIALIZE 'COUNTER' WITH A VALUE 2 
4. DIVIDE 'n' WITH THE COUNTER 
5. IF THE REMAINDER IS 0 DISPLAY THAT 'n' IS COMPOSITE AND STOP THE ALGORITHM 
6. ELSE INCREMENT THE 'COUNTER' AND REPEAT FROM STEP 4 UNTIL THE 'COUNTER' VALUE IS LESS THAN 'n' 
7. AFTER COMPLETION OF ALL THE STEPS DISPLAY THAT THE NUMBER  'n' IS PRIME
8. STOP
